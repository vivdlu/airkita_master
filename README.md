<strong>Project Name</strong>
<p>Airkita</p>
<strong>Project Summary</strong>
<p>Airkita is an adorable Akita dog who monitors your home air quality and alerts you with a text when pollution levels are unhealthy!</p>
<p>Indoor air quality is 2-5x more polluted than outside air. Knowing your home’s air quality is important — and building an environmental monitor is a way to visualize the invisible properties of the air you inhale.</p>
<p>Airkita is powered by a small, internet-enabled environmental monitor which can track the amount of Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs) present in the air.</p>
